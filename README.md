# twitter-bookmarks-export

Export your Twitter Bookmarks to JSON. This will also delete all your Twitter Bookmarks, 50 Bookmarks at a time, to get around API limits. The Bookmarks fetch API is unreliable, so this program runs until manually interrupted.

Based on [this Twitter API sample code](https://github.com/twitterdev/Twitter-API-v2-sample-code/blob/main/Bookmarks-lookup/bookmarks_lookup.rb).
